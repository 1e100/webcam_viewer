# Webcam Viewer

I needed a simple UI to show the feed from my USB microscope, so I told
Codex to write it. After a considerable amount of my input, this is the
result. While it took a lot of iterations, Codex did the job. Zero lines
in this repo (except for the readme) are written by a human. Indeed I
can't even review this code properly - I don't know Gtk4, so use the code
with that in mind.
